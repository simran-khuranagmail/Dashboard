    <h1>Welcome to Hackernoons</h1>
    <p>Organizations feel they are ending up into a cloud vendor lock in and expecting more freedom to choose the most-appropriate cloud vendor for the identified workloads, and promote competitive and negotiated cloud subscription costs.
Packaging, deployment, orchestration of workloads in cloud is often based on cloud’s native frameworks, and needs re-configuration to be able to deploy on a different cloud platform.
How can we provision portable delivery of workloads across a multi-vendor cloud space, just like delivering parcels via a courier service.</p>
